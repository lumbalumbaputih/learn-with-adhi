# Learn with Adhi – Project Memory

## Owner
Adhi (adhiazure@gmail.com) – building this for his kids, Rayyan and Raya.

---

## ⚙️ Operating Procedure (SOP) – READ FIRST, follow every session

This project is built in **small, fully-shippable steps**. The #1 rule: **never end a session with half-finished work in the tree, and never let this doc go stale.** Both have bitten us before.

**The loop for EVERY change (no exceptions):**
1. **One small step at a time.** A "step" = one self-contained, working increment (e.g. *one* course gets the boss engine; *one* Track-D feature). Don't batch unrelated work into a giant commit.
2. **Verify it works** before moving on: grep your change, sanity-check the JS, confirm the disguise rules + wiring are intact (open it mentally / check the obvious failure modes).
3. **Update the docs in the SAME step** (non-negotiable – this is why the doc went stale before):
   - Move shipped items into **"What's Already Built"** and update their **Status** column.
   - Append a dated entry to **`PROGRESS.md`** (what changed, files touched, what's next).
4. **Commit + push** the step. Small, descriptive message. Every commit must leave the tree in a *working* state so a dropped session never loses or half-bakes anything.
5. Only then start the next step.

**Definition of Done** for any course/feature = it works **+** disguise intact **+** wired in all required places (see the wiring checklist below) **+** docs updated **+** committed & pushed. "Done" is never just "code written."

**Sources of truth:** this CLAUDE.md "What's Already Built" + Status = the current high-level state. `PROGRESS.md` = the chronological build log (newest on top). Keep BOTH current, every step.

**Branch/PR:** work on the assigned feature branch; open a **draft PR** early so each pushed step is saved & preview-deployed; keep the disguise + single-file rules below.

## The Core Mission: Rayyan's Accelerated Learning

**The goal:** Make Rayyan genuinely love and excel at both math and coding – learning 3–5 years ahead of his actual grade level.

**The constraint (critical):** Rayyan must never feel like he's doing advanced or "too hard" work. The moment he feels that, he makes excuses to stop. Every course must feel like a game or adventure, not school. Never reveal grade levels to him, never frame content as "advanced."

**Rayyan's profile:**
- Currently in **Grade 2 SD (elementary)** in Indonesia (~7–8 years old)
- Loves trains, KAI, and adventure themes
- Responds well to gamification (stars, progress bars, boss battles)
- Needs visual/interactive learning – not text-heavy

**The disguise strategy:**
- Never say "Kelas 3/4/5" in a way Rayyan sees – use adventure themes instead
- Themes per grade: KAI Train (Gr3), Space/Rocket (Gr4), Deep Ocean (Gr5), etc.
- For coding: never say "programming" or "coding" – say "mengajari robot" (teaching the robot), "membuat petualangan" (making adventures)
- Language: **Bahasa Indonesia UI + English for code/commands** (mirrors real programming, teaches tech vocabulary naturally)

## What's Already Built

### Math Ladder (`rayyan.html` hub)
| Course (what Rayyan sees) | Theme | Hidden Level | File | Key | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Petualangan Angka | Basic (no special theme) | Gr2 | `courses/math/rayyan-math-grade2-v1.html` | `rayyanMath` | ✅ Done (sound + boss battle 👾) |
| Petualangan KAI 🚂 | KAI Train Adventure | Gr3 | `courses/math/rayyan-math-grade3.html` | `rayyanMath3` | ✅ Done (sound + boss battle) |
| Petualangan Antariksa 🚀 | Space/Rocket Adventure | Gr4 | `courses/math/rayyan-math-grade4.html` | `rayyanMath4` | ✅ Done (sound + boss battle) |
| Laut Dalam 🌊 | Deep Ocean Adventure | Gr5 | `courses/math/rayyan-math-grade5.html` | `rayyanMath5` | ✅ Done (full boss + sound + rich interactions) |
| Kota Masa Depan 🏙️ | Future City builder | Gr6 | `courses/math/rayyan-math-grade6.html` | `rayyanMath6` | ✅ Done (full boss) |
| Lab Misteri X 🧪 | Mystery Lab (find the unknown X) | Gr7 | `courses/math/rayyan-math-grade7.html` | `rayyanMath7` | ✅ Done – **5-yrs-ahead algebra capstone** |

→ Math ladder now reaches **Gr7 = ~5 years ahead** (real algebra), fully disguised. **Math content target MET.**
→ ⚠️ Note (2026-06-04 audit + Phase 1 build): Gr2–4 used the *old basic engine*; Gr5–7 have the rich one. **Phase 1a ✅** added the `SFX` module (procedural Web Audio, hooked at `showToast()`) to Gr2–4 (coding v1 already had its own `AX` sound system). **Phase 1b (in progress):** a lite boss battle on chapter 6 (enemy + HP bar that drains with correct answers + hit anim + victory; no lives/timer yet) — **math Gr2–4 ✅ done** (enemies 👾/👹/👽), coding-v1 boss pending. **Plan-v2 Y1 ✅ (2026-06-09):** Gr2–4 also got Gr5's rich question types (`drag-sort`/`number-line`/`bar-fill`) back-ported, so the early courses are no longer MC/input-only.

### Coding Ladder (`rayyan.html` hub)
| Course (what Rayyan sees) | Theme | Hidden Concepts | File | Key | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pabrik Robot KAI 🤖 | Train Robot Factory | Sequencing → Conditionals → Loops → Variables → Functions → Integration | `courses/coding/rayyan-coding-v1.html` | `rayyanCoding` | ✅ Done (drag-blocks + `AX` sound; ch6 is a **full themed multi-step boss mission** — route stations that light up, signal/passenger state, 5 unlocking steps, confetti victory) |
| Robot Antariksa 🛰️ | Space Robots | Events, lists/arrays, nested loops, boolean logic, integration | `courses/coding/rayyan-coding-v2.html` | `rayyanCoding2` | ✅ Done (blocks + full boss) |
| Mantra Kode ✨ | Code Spells | `console.log`, variables, if/else, loops, functions | `courses/coding/rayyan-coding-v3.html` | `rayyanCoding3` | ✅ Lessons are fill-in-the-blank, **PLUS a real "Lab Mantra Bebas" JS sandbox** (type & run real JavaScript, live `console.log` output + real errors, sandboxed via `new Function`) — the "type real code" payoff is now real |
| Studio Pelukis Kode 🎨 | Code Painter (Canvas) | Coordinates, shapes, loops/patterns, randomness, animation | `courses/coding/rayyan-coding-v4.html` | `rayyanCoding4` | ✅ Lessons fill-in-the-blank, **PLUS a real "Kanvas Bebas" free-draw sandbox** (type `kotak`/`lingkaran`/`garis`/`tulis` commands → live canvas, real errors) — he paints his own art now |
| Buat Game-mu Sendiri 🎮 | Make Your Own Game | Game loop, sprite/input, spawning, collision, score/state | `courses/coding/rayyan-coding-v5.html` | `rayyanCoding5` | ✅ Lessons fill-in-the-blank, **PLUS a real playable "Kereta Lari" game** (🎮 Mainkan Game-mu! — canvas, jump, spawning obstacles, collision, score, game-over/restart) the kid plays & replays — the "build a game" payoff is now real |
| Robot Ahli Matematika 🤖 (Track C Bridge) | Use code to DO math | Shapes & angles, number patterns, order-of-ops, coordinates + `y=2x`, solve-for-X | `courses/coding/rayyan-bridge-v1.html` | `rayyanBridge` | ✅ Done (4 interactive canvases + Gr7-style boss + celebration animation; MC de-biased) |

→ All 5 coding rungs **+ the Track C "Bridge"** shipped & wired — **Rayyan now has 12 adventures.** v3/v5 lessons are still fill-in-the-blank but now have the **real** JS sandbox + playable game alongside them; the Bridge proves he can use code to *do* math.

### Raya's Content (younger sibling, ~3–4 years old)
- **Matematika Raya** (`courses/math/raya-math-v1.html`, key `rayaMath`) – visual, tap-to-count.
- **Belajar Bersama Raya** (`courses/learning/raya-learning-visual-v1.html`, key `rayaVisual`) – colors, shapes, animals, matching.
- **Logika & Pola Raya 🧩** (`courses/learning/raya-logic-v1.html`, key `rayaLogic`) – ✅ **early reasoning** (2026-06-09): 6 chapters × 5 q — patterns (what-comes-next) → size compare → odd-one-out → categories → 2-step sequencing → mixed review. Audio built-in from day one.
- **Jelajah Dunia 🌍** (`courses/learning/raya-world-v1.html`, key `rayaWorld`) – ✅ **world knowledge** (2026-06-10): 6 chapters × 5 q — Lawan Kata (opposites) → Tubuhku (body parts) → Makanan & Minuman → Kendaraan → Cuaca & Langit → BOSS mixed review. Emoji visuals for now (CC0-photo upgrade = X2; build env blocked image hosts). Renamed from "Dunia Raya" to avoid colliding with the hub page title.
- 🔊 **All 5 Raya courses have sound (2026-06-09/10):** SFX jingles + Web-Speech read-aloud (`id-ID`) with a "🔊 Dengarkan" button, auto-read questions, and spoken answer feedback — Raya can now play without a parent narrating. (Hardened 2026-06-09: deferred `speak()` after `cancel()` + utterance ref, fixing silent playback on Chrome/Android.)
- **Belajar Huruf Bersama Raya 📖** (`courses/learning/raya-literacy-v1.html`, key `rayaLiteracy`) – ✅ **literacy / pre-reading** (the big peer-gap closer): **9 chapters covering all 26 letters** — Vokal A-I-U-E-O → Konsonan B-G → H-M → N-T → Q-Z (recognition, each with an example word) → Bunyi Awal (beginning sounds, 🍎→A, 12q) → Besar & Kecil (upper/lowercase drag-match, all 26) → Kata Pertama (first words, IBU→👩, 10q) → BOSS Petualangan Huruf (mixed review). 66 questions, same Raya engine (parent read-aloud, stars, confetti, tap/drag). Wired in all 4 places (`raya.html`, `kids.html`, `auth.js`, `dashboard.html`).

> **Raya gap analysis (2026-06-04):** she was solid on early numeracy + colors/shapes/animals but had **zero literacy** — the single highest-leverage "ahead of peers" skill for a 3–4 yr old. `rayaLiteracy` closes that. ✅ **Logika & Pola** shipped 2026-06-09 (`rayaLogic`). ✅ **Jelajah Dunia** (world knowledge, = plan-v2 R3) shipped 2026-06-10 (`rayaWorld`) — her content ladder is now complete; remaining work is quality (X2 real photos).

- ~~`courses/learning/raya-learning-paud-v1.html`~~ — the never-wired near-duplicate of the visual course was **deleted 2026-06-10** (plan-v2 R4; its phantom `rayaLearning` key was already removed from the star lists on 2026-06-04).

### Games
- Petualangan Kereta (choose-your-own-adventure stories)
- Kereta Rayyan: Lari Cepat! (endless runner game)
- Cari Bersama Raya (find-it / Where's Waldo style)

## The Build Plan – Roadmap to "3–5 Years Ahead"

This is the master plan for which courses to build so Rayyan hits the goal: genuinely
loving + excelling at **both** math and coding, ~5 years ahead, with the disguise intact.

### Gap analysis – where he is vs. the target *(updated 2026-06-04 audit)*
- **Math:** ✅ ladder now reaches **Gr7** (real algebra, ≈5 yrs ahead). Content target **MET**. Remaining: back-port the boss/sound/rich-interaction engine into Gr2–4 (the earliest courses are the most bare – bad first impression).
- **Coding:** ✅ all 5 rungs shipped, and the two headline payoffs are now **real**: v3 has a live JS sandbox ("Lab Mantra Bebas") and v5 has a real playable game ("Kereta Lari"). (The chapter *lessons* in v3/v4/v5 are still fill-in-the-blank, but the real-code / real-game experiences now exist alongside them.) v1's ch6 turned out to be a full multi-step boss mission already (the old "label-only" note was wrong) — so all coding rungs now have real boss/payoff experiences.
- **Bridge:** ✅ **shipped** — Track C "Robot Ahli Matematika" (key `rayyanBridge`): the math×coding crossover where he uses code to draw shapes/angles, generate number patterns, evaluate order-of-operations, plot coordinates (incl. `y=2x`), and solve for X — capped by a boss + celebration canvas.
- **"Love it" layer (Track D):** ✅ **functionally complete**. Confetti + per-course boss battles + a daily streak (🔥 `rayyanStreak`) + a medal cabinet (🏅 8 badges) + a printable certificate (🏆 `window.print`) + a daily quest (⚡ Misi Harian, also the Track-E Flash Drill) + a **biome-tinted world map** (upcoming stops preview their region's colour) — all live on `rayyan.html` (Phase 2). Remaining big-ticket gaps are now in coding: the v1 boss and the Phase 3 "real code / real game" payoffs.

The content rungs are ~done; the job is now (1) make the *start* as fun as the rest, (2) make the "real code / real game" promises real, and (3) build the retention layer. A kid only gets 5 years ahead if he keeps showing up, so Track D is a first-class deliverable, not polish.

---

### TRACK A – Math Ladder: finish the climb to algebra
Same engine as existing math courses (6 chapters, ch6 = BOSS, stars, localStorage). New biomes
extend the one continuous adventure world.

**A1 · Math Gr6 – "Kota Masa Depan" 🏙️** (Future City builder · key `rayyanMath6`)
*Hidden: Kelas 6 SD. Theme ties to Adhi's Feifelusia city vision – build, measure & run a city.*
| Ch | What Rayyan sees | Hidden topic |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Suhu & Lantai Kota | Integers / negative numbers (operations) |
| 2 | Campur Bahan Bangunan | Ratio & proportion, scale |
| 3 | Roda Raksasa & Pipa | Circle – circumference & area (π) |
| 4 | Gedung Pencakar Langit | Volume & surface area (prisma, tabung, limas, kerucut, bola) |
| 5 | Peta Grid Kota | Coordinate plane (x/y, quadrants) |
| 6 | BOSS: Pusat Data Kota | Statistics (mean/median/mode, charts) + debit/rate |

**A2 · Math Gr7 – "Lab Misteri X" 🧪** (Mystery Lab: find the unknown X · key `rayyanMath7`) – **THE 5-YEARS-AHEAD CAPSTONE**
*Hidden: SMP Kelas 7 – the algebra leap. Reframed as a detective lab where every puzzle hides a secret "X" to uncover – abstraction disguised as mystery-solving, so it feels like the most exciting course, not the hardest.*
| Ch | What Rayyan sees | Hidden topic |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Kotak Petunjuk | Sets / himpunan (union, intersection, Venn) |
| 2 | Mesin Hitung Lab | Integer & fraction operations, intro powers/roots |
| 3 | Bahasa Rahasia | Algebraic expressions (variables, terms, simplify, substitute) |
| 4 | Temukan X! | Linear equations & inequalities, 1 variable – *solve for the unknown* |
| 5 | Uang & Skala Misi | Social arithmetic (profit/discount/interest) + ratio/scale |
| 6 | BOSS: Bukti Akhir | Lines, angles, triangles/quadrilaterals + mixed-mystery boss |

> ⚠️ Gr7 is dense. If 6 chapters feel cramped, split into **7a (Bilangan & Aljabar)** and **7b (Geometri & Data)**. Decide during build.

*(Stretch, optional: Gr8 – linear functions/graphs, Pythagoras, probability – only if he's flying.)*

---

### TRACK B – Coding Ladder: blocks → real typed code → his own game
Each is a single-file course, 6 chapters, BOSS finale, same stars/localStorage engine. Keep the
disguise: "mengajari robot", "membuat petualangan" – never "coding/programming". Indonesian UI + English code.

**B1 · "Robot Antariksa" 🛰️** (Space Robots · key `rayyanCoding2`) – intermediate block logic
| Ch | What Rayyan sees | Hidden CS |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tombol & Sinyal | Events ("when pressed / when arrived") |
| 2 | Daftar Muatan | Lists / arrays (add, remove, count, loop) |
| 3 | Ulang di Dalam Ulang | Nested loops (rows × columns) |
| 4 | Logika AND / OR / NOT | Boolean & compound conditions, operators |
| 5 | Robot Pintar | Combine variables + lists + logic to decide |
| 6 | BOSS: Misi Mars | Multi-step autonomous mission |

**B2 · "Mantra Kode" ✨💻** (Code Spells · key `rayyanCoding3`) – **the leap from drag-blocks to TYPING real code**
*Recommended language: **JavaScript** (matches this whole site; lets him eventually edit/build his own pages). Alt: Python. Frame typed code as "magic words you spell out".*
| Ch | What Rayyan sees | Hidden CS |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mantra Pertama | `console.log`, run code, fix typos (syntax) |
| 2 | Kotak Ajaib | Real variables (`let`, numbers/strings) |
| 3 | Mantra Bercabang | `if / else`, comparisons |
| 4 | Mantra Berulang | `for` / `while` loops |
| 5 | Resep Mantra | Real `function`s with params & return |
| 6 | BOSS: Mantra Gabungan | A small typed program (guessing/fortune game) |

**B3 · "Studio Pelukis Kode" 🎨** (Code Painter · key `rayyanCoding4`) – creative coding (Canvas)
*Visible output = huge motivation. Also secretly reinforces coordinates/angles from math.*
| Ch | What Rayyan sees | Hidden CS |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Titik & Garis | Coordinates, draw primitives |
| 2 | Bentuk & Warna | Shapes, color, fill |
| 3 | Pola Ajaib | Loops → repeating patterns/spirals |
| 4 | Acak! | Randomness / generative art |
| 5 | Gerak! | Animation loop (frame by frame) |
| 6 | BOSS: Kartu Animasi | Animated scene (a moving KAI train!) |

**B4 · "Buat Game-mu Sendiri" 🎮** (Make Your Own Game · key `rayyanCoding5`) – capstone
*He builds what he already plays (mirrors the train-runner game). Strongest possible payoff.*
| Ch | What Rayyan sees | Hidden CS |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Panggung Game | Game loop + canvas setup |
| 2 | Sang Pahlawan | Sprite + keyboard/tap input |
| 3 | Rintangan | Spawning & moving obstacles |
| 4 | Tabrakan! | Collision detection, lives |
| 5 | Skor & Bintang | Score, win/lose state |
| 6 | BOSS: Rilis Game-mu | Polish + "publish" his own playable page |

**B5 (stretch) · "Penjinak Data" 🐍** (Data Tamer · key `rayyanCoding6`) – intro Python + simple algorithms (sorting/searching as "taming data creatures"). Only after B4.

---

### TRACK C – The Bridge: "Robot Ahli Matematika" 🤖➗ — ✅ SHIPPED (`courses/coding/rayyan-bridge-v1.html`, key `rayyanBridge`)
*key `rayyanBridge`. Build **after B3 (needs drawing) + Gr6 (coordinates/geometry)**. Proves he can use code to DO math – cements both ladders into one skill.*
| Ch | What Rayyan sees | Links to |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Robot Penggambar Bentuk | Turtle/Canvas polygons → angles & shapes |
| 2 | Mesin Pola Bilangan | Loops generate sequences (multiples, patterns) |
| 3 | Kalkulator Buatan Sendiri | Operations + order of operations |
| 4 | Plot Peta Koordinat | Plot points/lines; gentle `y = 2x` graph |
| 5 | Detektif X | Code that solves for X → links to Gr7 algebra |
| 6 | BOSS: Visual Matematika | Animate a math idea end-to-end |

---

### TRACK D – "Make Him Love It" engagement layer (decides success)
Build alongside content. These keep him returning, which is what actually compounds into 5 years ahead.
- **Unified World Map** – upgrade `rayyan.html` so math + coding read as ONE connected world (two rails of one journey, or regions of one map), not separate subjects.
- **Daily Quest + Streak** – one small daily challenge pulling from already-completed topics (localStorage streak counter). Doubles as spaced-repetition review.
- **Badge / Medal Cabinet + Certificate** – collectible rewards per milestone; a printable "graduation" certificate at big bosses (real-world reward Adhi can hand over).
- **Boss battles between worlds + a Grand Boss** at the end of each ladder.
- **Fluency mini-games** (see Track E) surfaced as "Ayo Main!" games, not drills.
- Polish: sound, confetti/celebration, big tap targets, fast load.

### TRACK E – Foundation maintenance (no holes)
Going 5 years ahead is only safe if earlier skills stay sharp.
- **"Latihan Kilat" (Flash Drills)** – 60-second mixed mini-quizzes (times tables, mental math, past topics) framed as a game/race. Adaptive: revisit weak spots. Ties into the daily streak.

---

### Suggested build order (phases) – *status updated 2026-06-04*
1. ✅ **Phase 1 – finish the in-progress ladders:** A1 (Gr6 City) · B1 (Robot Antariksa). **DONE.**
2. ✅ **Phase 2 – the two big leaps:** A2 (Gr7 algebra) **DONE & solid** · B2 (Mantra Kode) now has a **real JS sandbox** ("Lab Mantra Bebas") so he actually types & runs code. **DONE.**
3. ✅ **Phase 3 – make it real & joyful:** B3 ✅ shipped · B4 now ends with a **real playable game** ("Kereta Lari") · v3 has a **real JS sandbox**. Track C "the Bridge" ✅ **now shipped too**.
4. ❌ **Phase 4 – love/retention layer (THE priority now):** unified/themed map, daily quest/streak, badges + printable certificate, Flash Drills. Barely started.
5. **Phase 5 – stretch:** B5 (Python) · Gr8 math.

**Next-up recommendation:** superseded by **Improvement Plan v3** below (2026-06-10) — Tracks A–E and Plan v2 are essentially done; v3 (new lesson formats) is the current prioritized queue.

---

## Improvement Plan v2 – 2026-06-09 (✅ shipped except X1 device pass + X2 Raya photos — superseded by Plan v3 below)

> Planning audit of all 17 course files (not just the docs). The original roadmap is ~complete:
> content ladders ✅, retention layer ✅, real sandbox/game payoffs ✅. What's left is **quality
> asymmetry**: Raya's courses are silent, and Rayyan's *first* courses are his plainest.
> Each item below = one SOP step (ship → verify → docs → commit/push). Ordered by leverage.

### Verified gaps this plan is built on (grepped 2026-06-09)
- **Raya has ZERO audio.** No SFX, no read-aloud in any of her 3 courses (`grep AudioContext|new Audio|speechSynthesis` → 0). A *literacy* course that never plays a letter **sound**, for a kid who can't read the prompts — every session requires a parent narrator.
- **Rayyan Gr2–4 are MC/input-only.** They got SFX + lite boss (Phase 1), but have 0 drag/canvas/number-line interactions, while Gr5 has `drag-sort`, `number-line`, `bar-fill`. His easiest courses are his most boring — backwards for a kid who quits when bored.
- **Coding v4 is the last ⚠️ course:** real demo canvases but the kid never draws his own art.
- **Misi Harian is random, not adaptive:** Track E promised "revisit weak spots" — wrong answers are never recorded anywhere.

### RAYA queue (bigger gaps, and she can't work around them herself)
**R1 · Suara untuk Raya 🔊 — read-aloud + SFX in all 3 Raya courses** — ✅ **DONE (2026-06-09)**
- All 3 Raya courses (`rayaLiteracy`, `rayaVisual`, `rayaMath`) now have: the `SFX` module (correct/wrong jingles + completion fanfare), a `Suara` read-aloud module (Web Speech API, `id-ID` voice, graceful no-op if unsupported), a **🔊 Dengarkan** button on every question, auto-read on question render, and spoken feedback (the `ok` line — e.g. "Hebat! Huruf A! Contoh: Apel" — letter *sounds*, not just shapes). Parent notices updated. Emoji are stripped from TTS via `cleanSay()`.

**R2 · New course: "Logika & Pola" 🧩** (key `rayaLogic`, `courses/learning/raya-logic-v1.html`) — ✅ **DONE (2026-06-09)**
- Shipped with 6 chapters × 5 questions (30 q): Pola Apa Selanjutnya? (AB/AAB/ABB patterns) → Besar & Kecil (size/length/height/weight compare) → Mana yang Beda? (odd-one-out incl. a color-dot round) → Kelompokkan! (categories) → Urutan Cerita (2-step sequencing: 🥚→🐣, 🐛→🦋) → Petualangan Logika (mixed review). Same Raya `pick` engine, R1 audio (SFX + Suara read-aloud + 🔊 Dengarkan) from day one, answer positions varied. Wired in all 4 places + count pills bumped (Raya now 4 courses).

**R3 · New course: "Jelajah Dunia" 🌍** (key `rayaWorld`, `courses/learning/raya-world-v1.html`) — ✅ **DONE (2026-06-10)**
- Shipped: 6 chapters × 5 q (30 q) — Lawan Kata (opposites) → Tubuhku (body parts) → Makanan & Minuman → Kendaraan (incl. 🚂 di rel!) → Cuaca & Langit → BOSS Petualangan Dunia (mixed). Same Raya engine + audio, wired in all 4 places, pills bumped (Raya now 5 courses).
- **Renamed from the planned "Dunia Raya"** — `raya.html` (the hub) was already titled "Dunia Raya", so the course name would have collided.
- ⚠️ Shipped with **emoji visuals, not the planned CC0 photos**: the build environment's network allowlist blocks image hosts (Wikimedia/Openverse tested 403). Photo upgrade (`assets/img/raya-world/`) moved into **X2** — needs a session with image-host network access (or Adhi drops photos into the repo).

**R4 · Raya housekeeping** — ✅ **DONE (2026-06-10)**
- Deleted the never-wired duplicate `courses/learning/raya-learning-paud-v1.html` and the dead `assets/js/sync.js` (+ its unused `<script>` tag in `rayyan.html`). Flagged for Adhi's confirmation in the PR per the SOP.

### RAYYAN queue
**Y1 · Rich interactions back-ported to Gr2–4** *(finish the first-impression fix properly)* — ✅ **DONE (2026-06-09)**
- Gr5's rich question types now live in all three early courses (renderers adapted to the old `state`/`showToast` engine, CSS ported, dispatch extended):
  - **Gr2:** `drag-sort` (urutkan 5,10,15,20,25) + `number-line` (🚂 marker, odd-number pattern → 9) in the *patterns* chapter.
  - **Gr3:** all 3 types — place-value `drag-sort` (7.001/7.010/7.100), pecahan `bar-fill` (1/2 of 6 kotak), pecahan `drag-sort` (1/4 → 1/3 → 1/2). 🚂 marker.
  - **Gr4:** all 3 types — rounding `number-line` (🚀 marker, 67 → 70), big-number `drag-sort` (89.998 → 100.000), tangki-roket `bar-fill` (3/4 of 8 = 6, sneaks in pecahan senilai).

**Y2 · v4 "Studio Pelukis Kode": let him paint 🎨** — ✅ **DONE (2026-06-09)**
- Added the **"Kanvas Bebas"** free-play screen (home button → `sKanvas`): type real JS drawing commands against an Indonesian helper API — `kotak(x,y,w,h,'merah')`, `lingkaran`, `garis`, `tulis`, `acak`, `bersihkan` — run via `new Function` with a 5000-shape guard, live `<canvas>` render, real error messages, command cheat-sheet, starter art (incl. a `for`-loop). Stretch (localStorage gallery) deferred to Y4.

**Y3 · Adaptive Misi Harian (finish Track E)** — ✅ **DONE (2026-06-09)**
- (a) All 6 math courses (Gr2–7) log wrong answers into localStorage `rayyanWeakSpots` (`{"<courseKey>:<chapterId>": {miss,last}}`) via a `logWeakSpot()` hook in `showToast` (old engine) / `handleAnswer` (rich engine). (b) `rayyan.html` Misi Harian: QUESTS are topic-tagged (kali/bagi/tambah/kurang/pecahan/pola), `WEAK_TOPIC_MAP` maps chapter ids → topics, daily pick is weighted `1 + min(misses,8)` (deterministic per day), and a correct review **heals** one miss on that topic.

**Y4 · "Karya-mu" shelf on `rayyan.html`** — ✅ **DONE (2026-06-10)**
- All three creations persist on success: v4 Kanvas Bebas → `rayyanKanvasArt` `{code,shapes,when}` (restored into the editor on reopen), v3 Lab Mantra → `rayyanMantraLab` `{code,when}` (idem), v5 Kereta Lari → `rayyanKeretaLari` `{best,when}` (game-over screen now also shows "Rekor: N").
- New **🖼️ Karya-mu** section on `rayyan.html` (after the medal cabinet, hidden until ≥1 creation exists): his last painting **re-rendered live** on a mini canvas (same `kotak`/`lingkaran`/… helper set as v4), his last typed spell as a code snippet (`textContent`, injection-safe), and his best runner score — each card links back to its course.

**Y5 · Stretch (only if he's flying):** Gr8 math biome · B5 Python "Penjinak Data".

### Cross-cutting
**X1 · Real-device pass 📱** — one session on the actual tablet/phone: tap-target sizes, speech-synthesis voice availability on the real device (id-ID voices vary by OS), Web-Audio-after-gesture, load time. Log findings in PROGRESS.md and fix the top 3.

**X2 · Asset richness pass 🖼️** *(unlocked by Adhi 2026-06-09: internet images/APIs allowed)* — upgrade visuals where it adds real learning/joy value, one course per step:
- ✅ **(2026-06-10) Kenney CC0 sprites downloaded** into `assets/img/kenney/` (platformer obstacles/clouds, space enemies/UFOs/meteor, 9 medals) from the GitHub mirror of the Kenney pack (kenney.nl itself + photo hosts are blocked by the env's network allowlist; mirror license verified CC0, every image visually vetted; see `assets/img/kenney/LICENSE.md`).
- ✅ **(2026-06-10) Both runner games upgraded:** the standalone `rayyan-train-run-v1.html` (sprite cactus/rock obstacles + sprite clouds) and v5's in-course "Kereta Lari" (sprite obstacles). All sprite drawing **falls back to the original vector/rect art if images fail** — hitboxes untouched.
- ✅ **(2026-06-10) Medal cabinet + Gr4 boss:** earned badges on `rayyan.html` show Kenney medal art (emoji corner-overlay keeps meaning, `onerror` emoji fallback); the Gr4 space boss 👽 is now a Kenney UFO sprite (same fallback).
- **Raya visual & literacy:** real CC0 photos for animals/objects (emoji → photo where recognition matters) — ⏳ still blocked: no reachable photo host in this env (Pixabay/Pexels/Wikimedia/Openverse all 403). Needs a different env or photos dropped into the repo.
- Follow the Technical Stack guardrails: download into `assets/`, license-check, never let a lesson depend on live network.

### Recommended order
`R1a (literacy audio)` → `R1b/R1c (other 2 Raya courses)` → `Y2 (v4 canvas)` → `Y1 (Gr2→3→4, one per step)` → `R2 (Logika & Pola)` → `Y3 (adaptive drill)` → `R3` → `Y4` → `R4/X1` → stretch.
*Rationale: R1 unlocks Raya's entire existing catalog for solo use (one mechanism, 3 courses); Y2 is the last broken promise; Y1 fixes what Rayyan actually touches first; new content (R2/R3) only after existing content is at full quality.*

### Decisions for Adhi (per SOP: pick the rec, note it, don't block)
- **R1 voice:** Web Speech API (free, offline-ish, instant) — recommended — vs. pre-recorded MP3s (consistent voice but heavy + violates single-file rule).
- **R4:** delete `raya-learning-paud-v1.html` (rec) vs. keep on disk.
- **Y2 command names:** Indonesian helper API (`kotak`, `lingkaran` — rec for age 7) vs. raw canvas JS.

### Per-course build spec (every new Rayyan course MUST follow)
- **One self-contained HTML file**, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, design-system tokens, mobile-first, big tap targets, minimal text, instant visual/audio feedback.
- **6 chapters**, chapter 6 = BOSS. Star rating per chapter.
- **localStorage shape:** `{ totalStars, progress: { <chapterId>: { stars } } }` (matches `getProgress()` in `rayyan.html`). Use the keys assigned above.
- **File naming:** math → `courses/math/rayyan-math-gradeN.html`; coding → `courses/coding/rayyan-<theme>-vN.html`.
- **Wire it up (3 places):** add to `ADVENTURES` (or `GAMES`) in `rayyan.html` (emoji, title, blurb, href, progressKey, totalChapters); add the new key to the `sumStars([...])` list in `kids.html`; bump the "X petualangan" pill + "/ N petualangan selesai" counts in `kids.html` and `rayyan.html`.
- **Disguise rules (non-negotiable):** no grade numbers Rayyan can see; adventure framing only; for coding say "mengajari robot / membuat petualangan", never "coding/programming". Indonesian UI + English code.
- **One world:** new themes must connect to the existing biomes (train → space → ocean → city → lab), so it feels like one journey.

### Definition of Done – the goal is reached when…
- **Math:** Gr6 + Gr7 shipped → ladder = ~5 yrs ahead (real algebra), disguised, Rayyan earns stars through the Gr7 boss.
- **Coding:** B1–B4 shipped → he goes from blocks to typing real code to **publishing a game he built himself**.
- **Bridge** shipped → he uses code to solve/visualize math.
- **Engagement layer** live → unified map, daily streak, badges, Flash Drills.
- **Behavioral proof:** Rayyan returns voluntarily, holds a streak, and never frames any of it as "hard" or "advanced."

### Decisions to confirm with Adhi (don't block – pick the rec, note it)
- Gr6 theme: **Future City** (recommended, ties to Feifelusia) vs. another biome (jungle/mountain/arctic).
- Gr7: keep **6 chapters** vs. split into **7a/7b**.
- First real language in B2: **JavaScript** (recommended) vs. Python.

## Improvement Plan v3 – 2026-06-10: Lesson-Format Diversification (the current build queue)

> **Adhi's green light (2026-06-10): lessons may use ANY format, not just the 6-chapter quiz engine.**
> The diagnosis: all 17 courses share one DNA — *question → answer → toast → stars*. Even the
> "rich" interactions (drag-sort, number-line) are still quiz items wearing costumes. That
> monoculture is now the quality ceiling: a 3–4 yr old learns through **story and play**, not
> assessment; a 7–8 yr old racing 5 years ahead needs **exploration and construction** to build
> intuition, not just answer-checking. v3 adds *new lesson shapes* — each one still a single
> self-contained HTML file, still disguised, still wired into the same hub/star system.

### The five formats (each pilot = one SOP step: ship → verify → docs → commit/push)

**F1 · Raya: "Buku Cerita Ajaib" 📖✨ — interactive read-aloud storybook** *(pilot first — highest leverage)*
- A tap-along picture book, NOT a quiz: full-screen emoji-scene pages, auto read-aloud (reuse the
  hardened `Suara` module), one gentle interaction per page ("tap the red balloon", "tap each duck
  to count them — *satu, dua, tiga!*"), **no wrong answers, no fail state** — every page ends in
  delight. Learning rides inside the narrative (counting, colors, opposites = stealth review of
  her whole catalog).
- Pilot story: **"Kiki si Kucing Naik Kereta"** 🐱🚂 (ties Raya's world to Rayyan's train biome —
  one family universe). ~10 pages, 1 interaction each.
- File `courses/learning/raya-story-v1.html`, key `rayaStory`. Progress: finishing the book = full
  stars for its single "chapter" (keeps the standard `{totalStars, progress}` shape so all 4 wiring
  points work unchanged; the kid sees stickers, not scores).

**F2 · Rayyan: "Timbangan Misteri" ⚖️ — equation-balance manipulative lab** *(deepest learning win)*
- A real direct-manipulation toy: a balance scale he keeps level by dragging weights and mystery
  boxes (❓ = X) onto pans. Levels climb from numeric balancing → find the hidden box's weight →
  *remove the same thing from both sides* — he discovers **solving for X by feel**, the intuition
  the Gr7 quiz course can't teach. No multiple choice anywhere; the scale tipping IS the feedback.
- 6 levels-as-chapters (level 6 = BOSS: two boxes / two-step equations), stars by attempts, lives
  in the **Lab biome** next to Lab Misteri X.
- File `courses/math/rayyan-balance-v1.html`, key `rayyanBalance`. Drag via pointer events (same
  pattern as the existing `drag-sort`); scale tilt = CSS transform on a beam, weights re-parent
  between pans.

**F3 · Raya: "Papan Tulis Ajaib" ✏️ — letter-tracing board** *(closes the literacy loop)*
- Her literacy course teaches letter *recognition*; this adds **pre-writing**: trace letters with a
  finger on a canvas over a dotted guide with a start-arrow. Forgiving detection (sample the guide
  path; stroke must cover ~80% of points within a fat radius — no order strictness beyond
  start-zone). On success: the letter animates, `Suara` says its sound + an example word, confetti.
- Scope: the 5 vowels + R-A-Y (her name!) first = 8 letters in v1; chapters = letter groups.
- File `courses/learning/raya-tracing-v1.html`, key `rayaTracing`.

**F4 · Rayyan: "Masinis Kapi" 🚆 — mission-simulation lesson** *(the big one — build after F1–F3)*
- He IS the train driver: a side-scrolling cab view where missions *require* math to proceed —
  fuel purchase (rate × distance), departure-board arithmetic (elapsed time), passenger loading
  (multiplication/division into carriages), speed-limit zones (compare/round). The math is the
  *controls of the game*, never a quiz interrupt. Wrong math = funny consequence (overshoot the
  station), retry instantly.
- 6 missions-as-chapters, mission 6 = BOSS (a full timetabled run). Reuses the runner-game canvas
  muscle + Kenney sprites. File `courses/games/rayyan-masinis-v1.html`, key `rayyanMasinis`.

**F5 · Stretch: "Cerita Pilihanmu: Misteri di Stasiun" 🔍 — Rayyan story-quest**
- Branching interactive fiction where embedded puzzles gate the plot (a cipher = pattern practice,
  a locked door = equation). Builds on the existing choose-your-own-adventure engine. Only after
  F1–F4 land.

### Format-specific build rules (extends, not replaces, the per-course spec)
- Everything in the v2 per-course spec still applies (single file, disguise, 4-place wiring,
  design tokens, Raya audio from day one) **except** the "6 chapters of questions" shape — formats
  may define chapters as pages/levels/missions, as long as the localStorage shape stays
  `{ totalStars, progress: { <chapterId>: { stars } } }` so `getProgress()`/sync/dashboard work untouched.
- **No-fail formats (F1/F3):** completion always awards full stars; difficulty lives in the
  interaction, never in punishment. Raya must never see a ❌.
- **Manipulative/sim formats (F2/F4):** the world state IS the feedback (scale tips, train
  overshoots) — avoid toast-popup "Salah!" patterns entirely.
- New formats still connect to the one adventure world (Kiki rides the SAME train; the balance lab
  sits in the Lab biome; Masinis runs the KAI line).

### Recommended order & rationale
`F1 (Raya storybook)` → `F2 (balance lab)` → `F3 (tracing)` → `F4 (Masinis sim)` → `F5 (stretch)`.
*F1 first: Raya's entire catalog is quiz-shaped and she's the age where story IS the curriculum —
one pilot proves the no-fail format cheaply. F2 second: it's the single deepest learning upgrade
for Rayyan's capstone skill (algebra intuition). F3 is small and closes literacy. F4 is the
biggest build, so it goes after the format patterns are proven.*

### Decisions for Adhi (per SOP: pick the rec, note it, don't block)
- **F1 progress model:** full stars on book completion (rec — keeps hub wiring untouched) vs. a
  separate starless "sticker book" system.
- **F2 placement:** wire as a math ADVENTURE in the Lab biome (rec) vs. under GAMES.
- **F3 letter set:** vowels + R-A-Y-A's letters first (rec — her own name is the killer feature)
  vs. straight A–Z order.

## Technical Stack
- Pure HTML + CSS + Vanilla JS, single-file per course
- No build tools, no frameworks
- **External resources (Adhi's green light, 2026-06-09):** internet images/APIs ARE allowed to make courses richer. Guardrails:
  - **Prefer downloaded assets over hotlinks:** fetch free-license images/sprites/sounds (CC0/free: Pixabay, Pexels, Kenney.nl game assets, OpenMoji/Twemoji SVGs) into `assets/img/` / `assets/audio/` and reference locally — richness without runtime network risk (kid on a tablet, lesson must never break on flaky wifi). Hotlinking a stable CDN (jsDelivr) is acceptable as a fallback.
  - **Browser-native APIs freely:** `speechSynthesis` (read-aloud), Web Audio, Canvas — no network needed.
  - **Runtime third-party APIs only with a graceful offline fallback** (course must still be fully playable without it). Pre-vet every image — nothing dynamically fetched and unreviewed should ever render in front of the kids.
  - License-check everything (CC0 / explicit free license); note the source in PROGRESS.md when adding assets.
- Hosted on Vercel (learn-with-adhi project)
- Progress stored in localStorage (per-course keys: `rayyanMath`, `rayyanMath3`, etc.)
- Hub page: `kids.html`
- All kids courses in: `courses/math/`, `courses/coding/`, `courses/games/`, `courses/learning/`

## Design System
- Font display: Bricolage Grotesque (bold, playful)
- Font body: Nunito or Inter (readable for kids)
- Colors: --tomato, --mango, --forest, --sea, --mawar, --indigo
- Background: --paper (#FBF4E6 warm cream)
- Interactive: bold borders (2px solid var(--ink)), hover = translate(-4px,-4px) + box-shadow
- Card pattern: emoji thumb + card-body with title, blurb, progress
- Stars counter in header (localStorage-persisted)

## Notes for Future Claude Sessions
- **"The Build Plan" section above is the source of truth** for what to build next for Rayyan, in what order, with assigned themes/keys/chapters. Update it as courses ship (move them into "What's Already Built").
- Always keep the "disguise" intact – no grade numbers visible to Rayyan in the adventure courses
- The math and coding ladder should feel like ONE continuous adventure world, not separate subjects
- Raya is younger (PAUD) – her content is visual-only, minimal reading, tap/drag interactions
- **Wiring a new Rayyan (kids) course:** update the `ADVENTURES`/`GAMES` array in `rayyan.html`, add its key to `sumStars([...])` in `kids.html` AND to `PROGRESS_KEYS_BY_TYPE` in `assets/js/auth.js` (for cloud sync) AND to `COURSE_NAMES` in `dashboard.html` (for the parent view), and bump the count pills. (For *adult* courses instead, update `index.html` / `assets/courses.json`.)
- **2026-06-04 audit:** all 12 Rayyan adventures (incl. the Track C Bridge) + 2 Raya courses are shipped & wired (this doc previously under-counted them). Math answers spot-checked correct. Fixed disguise leaks: the Gr2–5 `<title>` and bug-report `courseName` no longer show "Kelas N" (theme names only). Biggest remaining gaps: the Track D retention layer, and the faked "real code"/"real game" payoffs in coding v3/v5.
- **Dead code:** ~~`assets/js/sync.js`~~ **deleted 2026-06-10** (plan-v2 R4) — it duplicated `assets/js/auth.js` (the live per-kid Firestore sync) and was never initialized; its lone `<script>` tag in `rayyan.html` was removed with it.
- **Tutor name:** ✅ unified to **"Kapi"** across all math courses (Gr2–4 were "Kai"/"Nova" → now Kapi; Gr5–7 already Kapi; Gr7 keeps the "Detektif Kapi" themed variant). The internal CSS classes/ids (`kai-name`, `nova-msg`, etc.) were left as-is (not visible to Rayyan).
